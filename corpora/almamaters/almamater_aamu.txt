Alabama A&M
Rich in heritage divine
Bless'd by the life of Councill brave
Who gave his all that thou might'st shine.

Many thy brave and loyal sons
Sent from thy shrine on Normal's Hill
Filled with a zeal from tasks well done
Anxious thy mandates to fulfill.

Long may you live to bless the world 
For right and justice take a stand
As from your rocky heights you view 
Your children's work throughout the land.

Alma Mater, blest be thy name.
Long live thy fame; long live thy fame!
