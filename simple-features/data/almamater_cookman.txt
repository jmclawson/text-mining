Dear Alma Mater, thou beloved, 
We pledge our lives to thee,
Thou art results of toil and pain 
And tears come in a stream;
Dear Alma Mater, thou art all
And all the world to me – 
Thou’rt the answered prayer of a dream.

Oh, God, protect dear B-CC 
Crown her with love and cheer; 
We’ll ever sing thy praise to Thee, 
It makes us strong and bold. 
All hail to thee dear B-CC 
All hail to thee, all hail!
Hail thee, Maroon and Gold.
Amen
