O Southern, Dear Southern, Thy praises we shall sing
Until all the heavens and echoes loudly ring
The winds of the sky, as they pass us by
Will adoration bring.

O Southern, Dear Southern, We owe our all to thee
In downfall or victory weâ€™ll always loyal be
Thy sons and daughters as they work,
Will be inspired by thee.

O Southern, Dear Southern, Thy name will ever be
As mighty as the river that flows on to the sea
As pure and true as the Gold and Blue,
That stand out bold for thee.
