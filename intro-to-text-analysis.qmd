## Text is unlike other data.

-   Not structured. Not numeric.

-   Meaningfully ordered. Meaningful units.

-   Each kind of data deserves its own approach.

## There are many ways to analyze text.

### ![](images/list.number@2x.png){style="vertical-align:middle" width="45"} Count

-   Basically, count the words.
-   "Bag of words" name describes lack of context.
-   Good to figure out which words are used the most.
-   (But not every common word is useful.)

### ![](images/books.vertical.fill@2x.png){style="vertical-align:middle" width="41"} Weight

-   Apply a weight for each term by its use in each document.
-   TF-IDF (Term-frequency---inverse document-frequency)
-   When you have a big pile of documents, TF-IDF is good to help figure out the things that differentiate them.
-   (But if documents are similar, these shared traits may be ignored.)

### ![](images/doc.text.magnifyingglass@2x.png){style="vertical-align:middle" width="29"} Look up

-   Look up each word in a "dictionary" / table to find its value.

-   Sentiment analysis

-   Useful for quickly adding value to a messy pile of text, based on the thing you're trying to find.

-   (But the dictionary needs to be made first, and it might suffer in quality.)

### ![](images/mouth.fill@2x.png){style="vertical-align:middle"} NLP

-   Find grammatical purpose for each word.

-   Natural Language Processing

-   NLP can be a helpful tool to distinguish actual meaning in a text or find patterns of style.

-   (But as a machine-learning technique, it's complicated and not perfect.)

### ![](images/text.redaction@2x.png){style="vertical-align:middle" width="38"} Context

-   Find words around each word to try to guess similar meanings.
-   Word Vector Models and Topic Models
-   Good for getting a sense of how words are used or what topics are dominant in a document or set of documents.
-   (As a machine-learning technique, it's complicated and can also take a lot of time to prepare---and the results still require interpretation.)

## Leftovers

-   "Bag of words" models (e.g., basic counting)

-   Term weighting (e.g., TF-IDF)

-   Dictionary-based analysis (e.g., Sentiment analysis)

-   Natural Language (pre-)Processing (e.g., POS, lemmatizing, dependency parsing)

-   Context-aware analysis (e.g., Word Vector Embeddings)
